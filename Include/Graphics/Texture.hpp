	 * There are two types of filter usage of this enum:
	 * One is for the 'min filter' which is used when the rendered texture is smaller than the original one, represented by GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER.
	 * Another is for the 'mag filter' which is used when the rendered texture is larger than the original one, represented by GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER.
	 * The mip map is a optimization for rendering far objects. GL will make several copies of a image which is smaller in size. These copies are of priority, which means they will be used instead of the original one when the target position is farther than a specific distant.
	 * In some ways, the mip maps and the original image are  by a texture.
